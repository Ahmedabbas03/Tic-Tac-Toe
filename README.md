# Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

This is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++. Two players take turns to mark the cells in a 3Ã—3 grid with X and O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to Play

- The game board is a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on an empty cell.
- To place a mark, enter the row and column numbers when prompted.
- The game ends when there is a winner or all cells are filled.

## Code Overview

The main parts of the code are:

- **Board Initialization**: The board is initialized as a 3x3 array filled with spaces.
- **Player Turn Management**: The game alternates turns between player X and player O.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that player input is within the valid range and the chosen cell is empty.
- **Winner Checking**: After each turn, the code checks for a winning combination in rows, columns, and diagonals.
- **Game End**: The game ends when there is a winner or the board is full, and the result is displayed.
